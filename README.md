# Thesis_data_augmentation
We have developed an augmentation strategy that advances the field by integrating explainable
constraints derived from ensemble model logic into the sample generation process. By relying on
class-specific boundaries and employing a heuristic optimization routine grounded in genetic
algorithms, our method ensures that all generated data points are semantically valid, diverse, and
explicitly traceable to decision rules learned by the model. In doing so, it addresses a critical gap in
the literature by offering a principled framework for explainable and constraint-compliant data
augmentation.
